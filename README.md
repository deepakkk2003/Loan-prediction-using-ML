# Loan-prediction-using-ML
This project presents a comprehensive solution for loan approval prediction using machine learning. It utilizes a dataset with 4269 records and 13 features, including key attributes like loan ID, number of dependents, education level, self-employment status, and annual income. The workflow involves detailed exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and model development, leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to optimize accuracy. Documented in a Jupyter notebook, the process includes feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning to enhance predictive performance. Additionally, the app.py script integrates the trained model into a functional application, enabling real-time loan approval predictions. This project exemplifies the integration of data analysis and application development, providing an efficient and scalable tool for financial decision-making.
